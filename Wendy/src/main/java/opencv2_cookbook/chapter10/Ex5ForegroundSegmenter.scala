/** The first example for section "Extracting the foreground objects in video" in Chapter 10, page 272.
  *
  * Background / foreground segmentation is implemented in class `BGFGSegmenter`.
  *
  * Unlike in the C++ implementation, we do not need to pass `BGFGSegmenter` as a parameter to `VideoProcessor`,
  * since `VideoProcessor` need only access to method `process`. This simplifies implementation of `VideoProcessor`.
  * We can pass only the method `process` itself.
  * Scala will treat `process` as a "closure", that is method `process` will have access to all local member variables
  * in class `BGFGSegmenter`.
